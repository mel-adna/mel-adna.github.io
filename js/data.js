🛠️ Technology Stack
This project is built using Flutter and leverages several powerful libraries to ensure performance and reliability:
• Framework: Flutter (SDK ^3.10.1)
• State Management: Riverpod
• Computer Vision: Google ML Kit
• Architecture: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

🧠 How It Works (The Logic)
The core functionality revolves around the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), a scalar value that indicates the openness of the eye.

1. Face Detection & Landmark Extraction: The app uses Google ML Kit to detect faces and extract landmarks.
2. EAR Calculation: Calculates the ratio of distances between eyelid points to detect blinking/drowsiness.
3. Smoothing & Thresholds: Uses rolling average to prevent false positives.
4. Alert System: Triggers audio, haptic, and visual alerts when drowsiness is detected.

🤖 Interaction with Mobile Learning (On-Device ML)
• Input: Raw camera feed.
• Inference: ML Kit Face Detection runs on-device.
• Output: Face landmarks for EAR calculation.`,
